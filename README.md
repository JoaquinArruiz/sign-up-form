# Sign-up Form

A simple sing-up form for TOP's project. (not functional)

You can check the live test at: [Sign-up Form: Live Page](https://joaquinarruiz.github.io/sign-up-form/)

#### Process and Some Thoughts:
Started with the box model and the css, added my own logo + hyperlinks, asked for a friend for a cool photo (credits in the live test), finishing with some js for the password validation. Very cool project not so challenging. (Guide used: [TOP's Sign-up Form guide](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png))
As always you can check the project at the footer (or clicking the page title!)

Really cool project, love the design part.

#### Known Issues:   
- Need to add more validations via JS    
- Would be cool to change the background color maybe, to something more profesional
